VQC vs Classical Machine Learning for Churn Prediction

This repository demonstrates a comparative analysis between **Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC)** and traditional **classical machine learning models** for solving a real-world customer churn prediction problem.

Using a complex churn dataset, we evaluate how a quantum-enhanced model (VQC implemented via Qiskit Machine Learning) performs against widely-used classical models including:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

 Key Highlights:
- Feature scaling and preprocessing using `MinMaxScaler`
- Quantum circuit design with `PauliFeatureMap` and `TwoLocal`
- Optimization using `SPSA`
- Evaluation using `accuracy`, `classification_report`, and visualizations

The goal is to assess whether quantum models can match or surpass classical techniques in binary classification tasks — especially in terms of prediction performance and computational behavior.
